Developed a full-stack Employee Management System using Spring Boot (Java) for the backend, JSP for the frontend, and MySQL as the database. 
The system includes complete CRUD operations, following the MVC architectural pattern, with data persistence managed through JPA/Hibernate.

Features:

Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) employee records
User-friendly interface with JSP and Bootstrap 
Data persistence with MySQL and JPA
Clean separation of concerns using MVC

Demo:
A demo video showing the functionality and user interface of the system is available in the repository under the file: employee-system-video.mp4. As well as some images showing the web application.
